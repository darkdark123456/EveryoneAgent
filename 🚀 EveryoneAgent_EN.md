# 🏛 Layered Architecture


EveryoneAgent follows a layered architecture:


```text
+---------------------------+
|        Web Layer          |
+---------------------------+
|       Router Layer        |
+---------------------------+
|       Agent Layer         |
+---------------------------+
|      Workflow Layer       |

# 📦 Core Architecture

The Core layer is the heart of EveryoneAgent.

It controls:

- Agent execution
- Task planning
- Workflow orchestration
- Memory management
- Conversation handling
- Prompt construction
- Local AI inference


The Core layer does not contain specific business implementations.

Its responsibility is:

> **Thinking + Scheduling + Execution**

---

# 🤖 Agent


```text
Core/

└── Agent
```


Agent is the brain of EveryoneAgent.

All user requests enter the Agent layer first.


Agent responsibilities:

- Receive requests
- Create tasks
- Call Planner
- Execute workflows
- Return results


---

# Agent Lifecycle


```mermaid
graph LR

Request

-->

---

# Agent Responsibilities


| Function         | Description              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Request Handling | Receive user requests    |
| Task Creation    | Generate execution tasks |
| Planning         | Call Planner             |
| Execution        | Run workflows            |
| Response         | Return final output      |


---

# 🧩 Planner


```text
Core/

└── Planner
```


Planner is the decision-making center.

It does not execute tasks directly.

Instead, it decides:

- What should be done?
- Which tool should be used?
- Should memory be loaded?
- Should knowledge be searched?
- Which model should be called?


Planner answers:

> "What should happen next?"


---

# Planner Workflow


```mermaid

---

# Planner Responsibilities


| Function            | Description               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Intent Analysis     | Understand user intention |
| Task Planning       | Create execution plan     |
| Tool Selection      | Select proper capability  |
| Memory Access       | Load historical context   |
| Prompt Construction | Build model input         |


---

# 🔄 Workflow


```text
Core/

└── Workflow
```


Workflow executes the plan created by Planner.


EveryoneAgent uses workflow-based execution.

Workflow is responsible for:

- Step execution
- Tool calling
- Model calling
- Result processing


---
